      <h2>Hello, I'm Yesha Burca ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a passionate <strong>photographer and multimedia artist</strong> based in the Philippines. 
        I specialize in capturing authentic stories through photography â€” from breathtaking landscapes 
        and vibrant cityscapes to raw, emotional portraits.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <strong>2nd-year Multimedia Arts student</strong>, Iâ€™m constantly exploring new creative 
        approaches to storytelling. My goal is to not just take pictures, but to preserve moments that 
        inspire and connect people.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Iâ€™m not behind the camera, I enjoy experimenting with film, design, and creative projects 
        that allow me to collaborate with other artists. Through my work, I hope to bring fresh perspectives 
        and share the beauty of everyday life.
